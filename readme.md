# About this project

This is a react native project built using expo CLI and it uses all the best practises and industry standards of writing code. It a food delivery app that has firebase, google maps and stripe integration. It was started as a code along project from an online course but ultimately ended up being a good learning project of fixing old depreciated code.

The key things achieved by me through this project were -

- React fundamentals like - react hooks, context API, react native navigation
- Firebase authentication, functions and deployment
- Stripe integration
- Google maps
- Some Animations library
- Async storages
- Camera module integration
